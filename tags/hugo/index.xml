Files where ok for a very old version, but config changes no longer followed the newer conventions as suggested by Hugo. Also my carefully adapted theme had fallen to pieces and didn't render no more, so kiss theme to the rescue!
Also automation happened and we now have Github Actions which is a perfect solution to build and deploy Hugo pages to GitHub Pages.</description></item></channel></rss>

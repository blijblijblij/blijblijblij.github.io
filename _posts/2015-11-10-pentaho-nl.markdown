<p>Last weekend the European Pentaho User meetup (<a href="https://github.com/PentahoCommunityMeetup2015/info/blob/master/README.md">#pcm15</a>) was held in London. Two days of hacking, technical talks and beer was the perfect recipe to make a great meeting.</p>

We had great talks, and I caught up with some Dutch colleagues and we concluded there should be some local NL followup to this community initiative!

So here it is, a Pentaho NL Usergroup: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Pentaho-NL-Meetup/">http://www.meetup.com/Pentaho-NL-Meetup/</a>, and it
would not be a meetup if there wasn't any <a href="https://twitter.com/PentahoNl">tweettweet</a>...

Soon we'll set out a first date, but please register on meetup!

Regards, Rogier

As we live in the golden age of Opensource software we shall not only take, but also give back if we can. Kicked off the [Pentaho NL meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Pentaho-NL-Meetup), try to [blog](http://blog.blijblijblij.com) [talk](https://github.com/blijblijblij/presentations) [tweet](https://www.twitter.com/blijblijblij) about usefull new stuff as I continue my quest through DataLand...

Currently employed by Data centric startup [ReelMetrics](https://www.reelmetrics.com), doing the DataDance, also build a Docker based, Mesos orchestrated, AWS supported infra to accelarate Pentaho based data products and Ruby on Rails frontends.
